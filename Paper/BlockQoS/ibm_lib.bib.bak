	were not considered. In this paper we present how a cardinality-based
	feature model can be also translated into a constraint satisfaction
	problem. In that connection, it is possible to use off-the-shelf
	tools to automatically accomplish several tasks such as calculating
	the number of possible feature configurations and detecting possible
	conflicts. In addition, we present a performance test between two
	off-the-shelf Java constraint solvers. To the best of our knowledge,
	this is the first time a performance test is presented using solvers

	in SPL. Most of the current proposals for automatic reasoning on
	SPL are not devised to cope with extrafunctional features. In this
	paper we introduce a proposal to model and reason on an SPL using
	constraint programming. We take into account functional and extrafunctional
	features, improve current proposals and present a running, yet feasible
	implementation.},

	This work outlines the use of the concept of features for modelling

	properties as well as quality-of-service (QoS) parameters, which
	can be applied to different parts of a distributed architecture.
	To do this we have extended the ideas and concepts of the FODA (Featured-Oriented

	Second, it uses an XSL-based mechanism to express complex composition
	rules for the features. Third, it offers a means to decompose large
	feature diagrams into extensible and self-contained modules. Fourth,
	it defines an XML-based approach to expressing the feature models
	that offers a low-cost path to the development of support tools for
	building the models. Fifth, it explicitly supports both the modelling
	of the product family and of the applications instantiated from it.
	The paper presents the feature modelling technique in the context
	of an on-going project to build a generative environment for family
	instantiation. The experience from two cases studies is also discussed.},

	the requirements of a set of similar applications in a software domain/product

	feature models based on requirements clustering, which automates
	the activities of feature identification, organization and variability
	modeling to a great extent. The underlying idea of this approach
	is to analyze the relationships between individual requirements and
	cluster tight-related requirements into features. With the automatic
	support of this approach, good quality feature models can be constructed
	in a more effective way. A case study is also provided to show the

	that because useful knowledge is no longer concentrated in a few
	large organizations, business leaders must adopt a new, "open" model
	of innovation. Using this model, companies look outside their boundaries
	for ideas and intellectual property (IP) they can bring in, as well
	as license their unutilized home-grown IP to other organizations.In
	Open Business Models, Chesbrough takes readers to the next step-explaining
	how to make money in an open innovation landscape. He provides a
	diagnostic instrument enabling you to assess your company's current
	business model, and explains how to overcome common barriers to creating
	a more open model. He also offers compelling examples of companies
	that have developed such models-including Procter \& Gamble, IBM,
	and Air Products.In addition, Chesbrough introduces a new set of
	players-"innovation intermediaries"-who facilitate companies' access
	to external technologies. He explores the impact of stronger IP protection
	on intermediate markets for innovation, and profiles firms (such
	as Intellectual Ventures and Qualcomm) that center their business
	model on innovation and IP.This vital resource provides a much-needed
	road map to connect innovation with IP management, so companies can
	create and capture value from ideas and technologies-wherever in
	the world they are found.},

	to rely entirely on their own ideas to advance their business, nor

	a result, says Harvard Business School professor Henry W. Chesbrough,
	the traditional model for innovation-which has been largely internally
	focused, closed off from outside ideas and technologies-is becoming
	obsolete. Emerging in its place is a new paradigm, open innovation,
	which strategically leverages internal and external sources of ideas
	and takes them to market through multiple paths. This path-breaking
	analysis is based on extensive field research, academic study, and
	the authors own longtime experience working in Silicon Valley. Through
	rich descriptions of the innovation processes of Xerox, IBM, Lucent,
	Intel, Merck, and Millennium, and the many spin-offs that have emerged
	from these firms, Open Innovation shows how companies can use their
	business model to identify a more enlightened role for R\&D in a
	world of abundant information, better manage and access intellectual
	property, advance their current business, and grow their future business.
	Arguing that companies in all industries must transform the way they
	commercialize knowledge, Chesbrough convincingly shows how open innovation
	can unlock the latent economic value in a companys ideas and technologies.},

	environments such as business processes for service automation. Recently,
	there are many studies that have tried to adopt workflows to ubiquitous
	computing. A service in the ubiquitous computing environments must
	be executed according to a user's situation information. However
	existing workflow systems have not yet included functions enough
	to support context-aware services for ubiquitous computing. In this
	paper, we propose a new context- aware workflow language and system
	for ubiquitous computing environments. The suggested language can
	specify context information on the transition constraints of a workflow,
	and support various workflow functions and adaptive services. And
	the proposed system can offer context-aware services according to
	user's service demand or situation information. We verify the efficiency
	of the suggested system, through comparison experiments with existing
	workflow systems such as FollowMe and uFlow.},

	generative technologies." -Charles Simonyi, Chief Architect at Microsoft
	Research and the inventor of Intentional Programming "The book develops
	strong themes around unifying principles that tie the pieces together,
	most notably domain engineering and metaprogramming. It is crucial
	to understand that this book is not just some refreshing diversion,
	nor just an exposition of some noteworthy niche techniques: It is
	a harbinger of a broader enlightenment that opens the door to a new
	age." -From the Foreword by James Coplien, a Distinguished Member
	of Technical Staff at Lucent Technologies, Bell Laboratories Generative
	Programming (GP) offers great promise to application developers.
	It makes the idea of moving from one-of-a-kind software systems to
	the semi-automated manufacture of wide varieties of software quite
	real. In short, GP is about recognizing the benefits of automation
	in software development. Generative Programming covers methods and
	tools that will help you design and implement the right components
	for a system family and automate component assembly. The methods
	presented here are applicable for all commercial development-from
	"programming in the small," at the level of classes and procedures-to
	"programming in the large," or developing families of large systems.
	Generative Programming is your complete guide and reference to this
	emerging discipline. It provides in-depth treatment of critical technologies
	and topics including: Domain Engineering Feature Modeling Generic
	Programming Aspect-Oriented Programming Template Metaprogramming
	in C++ Generators Microsoft's Intentional Programming Using this
	book you will learn how these techniques fit together and, more importantly,
	how to apply them in practice. The text contains three comprehensive
	case studies in three different domains: programming domain (container
	data structures), business domain (banking), and scientific computing
	(matrix computations).},

	Staged configuration can be achieved by the stepwise specialization

	choices available in each stage are defined by separate feature models.
	Staged configuration is important because in a realistic development
	process, different groups and different people make product configuration
	choices in different stages. Finally, we also discuss how multi-level
	configuration avoids a breakdown between the different abstraction
	levels of individual features. This problem, sometimes referred to
	as analysis paralysis , easily occurs in feature modeling because

  abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that some graph properties of protein
	interaction networks might be related with gene morbidity. In particular,
	it has been suggested that when a polymorphism affects a gene, it
	is more likely to produce a disease if the node degree in the interaction
	network is higher than for other genes. However, these results do
	not take into account the possible bias introduced by the variance
	in the amount of information available for different genes. This
	work models the relationship between the morbidity associated with
	a gene and the degrees of the nodes in the protein interaction network
	controlling the amount of information available in the literature.
	A set of 7461 genes and 3665 disease identifiers reported in the
	Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) was mined jointly with
	9630 nodes and 38756 interactions of the Human Proteome Resource
	Database (HPRD). The information available from a gene was measured
	through PubMed mining. Results suggest that the correlation between
	the degree of a node in the protein interaction network and its morbidity
	is largely contributed by the information available from the gene.
	Even though the results suggest a positive correlation between the
	degree of a node and its morbidity while controlling the information
	factor, we believe this correlation has to be taken with caution
	for it can be affected by other factors not taken into account in
	this study.},

	understanding of the nature, relevance and importance of creating
	and sustaining relationships as a strategic resource. It takes a
	managerial perspective to the study of relationships, from strategy
	to implementation. The first edition was the first text that comprehensively
	addressed relationships as a strategic issue, and considering relationships
	as strategic and as a basis for competition is central to this book.
	In a nutshell, strategic market relationships is the process of analyzing,
	formulating and implementing a relationship strategy for an organisation.
	The new edition is being totally restructured in the light of teaching
	experience with the book and new research since it was published.
	Most of the existing content will still be there but presented in
	a new logic. Continues to map relationships from strategy to implementation
	Text more clearly divided into strategy and implementation parts
	Continues to focus on close relationships and on the management of
	relationships Continues with introductory case illustration and end
	of chapter teaching cases with many new ones All chapter updated
	with new research since the last publication Revamped chapter on
	relationship planning including a stronger focus on strategic choice
	and relationship development New chapter on relationship types/archetypes
	to develop on the theme of classification and the management of specific
	relationships New chapter on organizing relationships New chapter
	on people and relationships E-relationship chapter integrated into
	chapter on communication and dialogue in a relationship New chapter
	on channel relationships Chapter on relationship performance restructured
	around costs and value. Ethics and researching relationships expanded

  title = {{Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures}},
  school = {University of California},
  year = {2000},
  address = {Irvine California USA},
  abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software
	architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale
	distributed hypermedia system. The Web has been iteratively developed
	over the past ten years through a series of modifications to the
	standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those
	aspects of the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable
	modifications, a model for the modern Web architecture was needed
	to guide its design, definition, and deployment. Software architecture
	research investigates methods for determining how best to partition
	a system, how components identify and communicate with each other,
	how information is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve
	independently, and how all of the above can be described using formal
	and informal notations. My work is motivated by the desire to understand
	and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application
	software through principled use of architectural constraints, thereby
	obtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired
	of an architecture. An architectural style is a named, coordinated
	set of architectural constraints. This dissertation defines a framework
	for understanding software architecture via architectural styles
	and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architectural
	design of network-based application software. A survey of architectural
	styles for network-based applications is used to classify styles
	according to the architectural properties they induce on an architecture
	for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce the Representational
	State Transfer (REST) architectural style and describe how REST has
	been used to guide the design and development of the architecture
	for the modern Web. REST emphasizes scalability of component interactions,
	generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and
	intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security,
	and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe the software engineering
	principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to
	retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other
	architectural styles. Finally, I describe the lessons learned from
	applying REST to the design of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and
	Uniform Resource Identifier standards, and from their subsequent
	deployment in Web client and server software.},

  abstract = {Design Patterns is a modern classic in the literature of object-oriented
	development, offering timeless and elegant solutions to common problems
	in software design. It describes patterns for managing object creation,
	composing objects into larger structures, and coordinating control
	flow between objects. The book provides numerous examples where using
	composition rather than inheritance can improve the reusability and
	flexibility of code. Note, though, that it's not a tutorial but a
	catalog that you can use to find an object-oriented design pattern
	that's appropriate for the needs of your particular application-a
	selection for virtuoso programmers who appreciate (or require) consistent,
	well-engineered object-oriented designs. Now on CD, this internationally
	acclaimed bestseller is more valuable than ever! Use the contents
	of the CD to create your own design documents and reusable components.
	The CD contains: 23 patterns you can cut and paste into your own
	design documents; sample code demonstrating pattern implementation;
	complete Design Patterns content in standard HTML format, with numerous
	hyperlinked cross-references; accessed through a standard web browser;
	Java-based dynamic search mechanism, enhancing online seach capabilities;
	graphical user environment, allowing ease of navigation. First published
	in 1995, this landmark work on object-oriented software design presents
	a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to common design problems.
	Created by four experienced designers, the 23 patterns contained
	herein have become an essential resource for anyone developing reusable
	object-oriented software. In response to reader demand, the complete
	text and pattern catalog are now available on CD-ROM. This electronic
	version of Design Patterns enables programmers to install the book
	directly onto a computer or network for use as an online reference
	for creating reusable object-oriented software. The authors first
	describe what patterns are and how they can help you in the design
	process. They then systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog
	recurring designs in object-oriented systems. All patterns are compiled
	from real-world examples and include code that demonstrates how they
	may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages such
	as C++ and Smalltalk. Readers who already own the book will want
	the CD to take advantage of its dynamic search mechanism and ready-to-install
	patterns.},

  abstract = {Ranking is a very important topic in information retrieval. While
	algorithms for learning ranking models have been intensively studied,
	this is not the case for feature selection, despite of its importance.
	The reality is that many feature selection methods used in classification
	are directly applied to ranking. We argue that because of the striking
	differences between ranking and classification, it is better to develop
	different feature selection methods for ranking. To this end, we
	propose a new feature selection method in this paper. Specifically,
	for each feature we use its value to rank the training instances,
	and define the ranking accuracy in terms of a performance measure
	or a loss function as the importance of the feature. We also define
	the correlation between the ranking results of two features as the
	similarity between them. Based on the definitions, we formulate the
	feature selection issue as an optimization problem, for which it
	is to find the features with maximum total importance scores and
	minimum total similarity scores. We also demonstrate how to solve
	the optimization problem in an efficient way. We have tested the
	effectiveness of our feature selection method on two information
	retrieval datasets and with two ranking models. Experimental results
	show that our method can outperform traditional feature selection
	methods for the ranking task.},

  abstract = {The urgent need for the performance of more, better designed, and
	better conducted randomised clinical trials is increasingly recognised.
	Based on structured interviews with leading persons of 43 outstanding
	organisations and units involved in clinical trials in Europe and
	North America during 1993, ways of organising and staffing clinical
	trial units were investigated. The present proposal is based on this
	experience from which an attempt to extract a composite set of minimal
	requirements has been made regarding pertinent objectives and aims,
	organisational aspects, staffing, and estimated costs of establishing
	a clinical trial unit. The core staff is suggested to consist of
	two chief physicians, one statistician, one data manager, one project
	coordinator, and two secretaries. In order to fulfil the minimal
	requirements for running such a unit, it is calculated that about
	GBP 450,000 per year is needed to cover investments, core staff,
	and running costs, but excluding housing costs and costs of randomised
	clinical trials that do not originate from trial coordination. In
	return, such a unit should be able to mount and launch 6-7 multicenter
	randomised clinical trials during a 5 year period, corresponding
	to a total cost for coordination per trial of about GBP 340,000.
	However, with a larger staff more studies may be coordinated possibly
	reducing the cost per trial depending on greater effectiveness in
	utilisation of the basic facilities.},

	automation, more experience reports on their usage in real projects
	are needed. This paper describes some challenges encountered during
	the re-engineering of PloneMeeting, an Open Source software family,
	into a software product line. The main challenging issues we could
	observe were (i) the ambiguity originating from implicit information
	(missing definitions of feature labels and unclear modelling viewpoint),
	(ii) the necessity of representing spurious features, (iii) the difficulty
	of making diagrams and constraints resistant to change, and (iv)
	the risks of using feature attributes to represent large sets of
	subfeatures. Our study reveals the limitations of current constructs,
	and calls for both language and methodological improvements. It also
	suggests further comparative evaluations of modelling alternatives.},

	of related systems and the commonality underlying those systems,
	it is possible to obtain a set of reference models, i.e., software
	architectures and components needed for implementing applications
	in the class. FORM (Feature-;Oriented Reuse Method) supports development
	of such reusable architectures and components (through a process
	called the "domain engineering" and development of applications using
	the domain artifacts produced from the domain engineering. FORM starts
	with an analysis of commonality among applications in a particular
	domain in terms of services, operating environments, domain technologies,
	and implementation techniques. The model constructed during the analysis
	is called a "feature" model, and it captures commonality as an AND/OR
	graph, where AND nodes indicate mandatory features and OR nodes indicate
	alternative features selectable for different applications. Then,
	this model is used to define parameterized reference architectures
	and appropriate reusable components instantiatable during application
	development. Architectures are defined from three different viewpoints
	(subsystem, process, and module) and have intimate association with
	the features. The subsystem architecture is used to package service
	features and allocate them to different computers in a distributed
	environment. Each subsystem is further decomposed into processes
	considering the operating environment features. Modules are defined
	based on the features on domain technology and implementation techniques.
	These architecture models that represent an architecture at different
	levels of abstraction are derived from the feature hierarchy captured
	in the feature model. Modules serve as basis for creating reusable
	components, and their specification defines how they are integrated
	into the application (e.g., as-;is integration of pre-;coded component,
	instantiation of parameterized templates, and filling-;in skeletal
	codes). Our experiences have shown that for the electronic bulletin
	board and the private branch exchange (PBX) domains, "features" make
	up for a common domain language and the main communication medium
	among application users and developers. Thus, the feature model well
	represents a "decision space" of software development, and is a good
	starting point for identifying candidate reusable components.},

	However, providing such tool support is a huge investment that can

	we have built an IDE for AHEAD that integrates all phases of feature-oriented
	software development. To reuse this investment for other tools and
	languages, we refactored FeatureIDE into an open source framework
	that encapsulates the common ideas of feature-oriented software development
	and that can be reused and extended beyond AHEAD. Among others, we
	implemented extensions for FeatureC++ and FeatureHouse, but in general,
	FeatureIDE is open for everybody to showcase new research results
	and make them usable to a wide audience of students, researchers,
	and practitioners.},

  abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are integrations of computation and physical
	processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the
	physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes
	affect computations and vice versa. The economic and societal potential
	of such systems is vastly greater than what has been realized, and
	major investments are being made worldwide to develop the technology.
	There are considerable challenges, particularly because the physical
	components of such systems introduce safety and reliability requirements
	qualitatively different from those in general- purpose computing.
	Moreover, physical components are qualitatively different from object-oriented
	software components. Standard abstractions based on method calls
	and threads do not work. This paper examines the challenges in designing
	such systems, and in particular raises the question of whether today's
	computing and networking technologies provide an adequate foundation
	for CPS. It concludes that it will not be sufficient to improve design
	processes, raise the level of abstraction, or verify (formally or
	otherwise) designs that are built on today's abstractions. To realize
	the full potential of CPS, we will have to rebuild computing and
	networking abstractions. These abstractions will have to embrace
	physical dynamics and computation in a unified way.},

	virtual machine (VM) placement to improve the network scalability.
	By optimizing the placement of VMs on host machines, traffic patterns
	among VMs can be better aligned with the communication distance between
	them, e.g. VMs with large mutual bandwidth usage are assigned to
	host machines in close proximity. We formulate the VM placement as
	an optimization problem and prove its hardness. We design a two-tier
	approximate algorithm that efficiently solves the VM placement problem
	for very large problem sizes. Given the significant difference in
	the traffic patterns seen in current data centers and the structural
	differences of the recently proposed data center architectures, we
	further conduct a comparative analysis on the impact of the traffic
	patterns and the network architectures on the potential performance
	gain of traffic-aware VM placement. We use traffic traces collected
	from production data centers to evaluate our proposed VM placement
	algorithm, and we show a significant performance improvement compared
	to existing general methods that do not take advantage of traffic
	patterns and data center network characteristics.},

	applications live on the Web as services, where they can be accessed
	using terminals of different types, such as regular computers, mobile
	devices, game consoles, and so on. The ability to dynamically combine
	data, code and other content from numerous web sites all over the
	world, and the ability to instantly publish services worldwide has
	opened up entirely new possibilities for software development. Such
	applications, referred to as mashups, are content aggregates that
	leverage the power of the Web to support instant, worldwide sharing
	of content. Unfortunately, for various reasons, the browser that
	is commonly used as the run-time environment of mashups is inadequate
	for hosting complex applications, in particular when considering
	embedded devices and subsystems that are not readily available in
	the web. In this paper, we introduce a runtime environment, intended
	for embedded devices, that is able to host mashups that combine data
	from the web and device specific peripherals, thus enabling context-aware
	mashups. As an example, we describe a mashup that combines map data
	from an existing map service and GPS data available from an external
	system.},

  abstract = {Use of flash memory as a storage medium is becoming popular in diverse
	computing environments. However, because of differences in interface,
	flash memory requires a hard-disk-emulation layer, called \{FTL\}
	(flash translation layer). Although the \{FTL\} enables flash memory
	storages to replace conventional hard disks, it induces significant
	computational and space overhead. Despite the low power consumption
	of flash memory, this overhead leads to significant power consumption
	in an overall storage system. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics
	of flash-based storage devices from the viewpoint of power consumption
	and energy efficiency by using various methodologies. First, we utilize
	simulation to investigate the interior operation of flash-based storage
	of flash-based storages. Subsequently, we measure the performance
	and energy efficiency of commodity flash-based \{SSDs\} by using
	microbenchmarks to identify the block-device level characteristics
	and macrobenchmarks to reveal their filesystem level characteristics.

	resources and web resources can be easily handled and seamlessly
	integrated into our life. However, due to the heterogeneity of devices
	and tight coupling of individual information systems, the developers
	cannot easily create their specific applications by combining with
	physical and web resources. In this paper, we proposed Rest Thing
	which is a restful web service infrastructure based on REST principles
	in order to hide the heterogeneity of devices and provide a seamless
	way to integrate embedded devices with existing web applications.
	Besides, we implemented a prototyping system, which provided the
	restful accessible way of the wireless sensors, and built a demo
	application on the smart phone to collect and merge physical and
	web resources. Finally, we gave the performance evaluation of the
	prototyping system.},

  volume = {51},
  pages = {456--479},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {Feature Diagrams (FDs) are a family of popular modelling languages
	used to address the feature interaction problem, particularly in
	software product lines, FDs were first introduced by Kang as part
	of the FODA (Feature-Oriented Domain Analysis) method back in 1990.
	Afterwards, various extensions of FODA FDs were introduced to compensate
	for a purported ambiguity and lack of precision and expressiveness.
	However, they never received a formal semantics, which is the hallmark
	of precision and unambiguity and a prerequisite for efficient and
	safe tool automation.The reported work is intended to contribute
	a more rigorous approach to the definition, understanding, evaluation,
	selection and implementation of FD languages. First, we provide a
	survey of FD variants. Then, we give them a formal semantics, thanks
	to a generic construction that we call Free Feature Diagrams (FFDs).
	This demonstrates that FDs can be precise and unambiguous. This also
	defines their expressiveness. Many variants are expressively complete,
	and thus the endless quest for extensions actually cannot be justified
	by expressiveness. A finer notion is thus needed to compare these
	expressively complete languages. Two solutions are well-established:
	succinctness and embeddability, that express the naturalness of a
	language. We show that the expressively complete FDs fall into two
	succinctness classes, of which we of course recommend the most succinct.
	Among the succinct expressively complete languages, we suggest a
	new, simple one that is not harmfully redundant: Varied FD (VFD).
	Finally, we study the execution time that tools will need to solve
	useful problems in these languages.},

	appropriately by current methods. This paper gives a brief overview

	Based on the applications of these approaches within an ongoing research
	project this paper proposes a formalized definition for feature modeling
	using the Object Constraint Language (OCL) and a set of associations
	and constraints to be used in the feature model. The relations between
	features in the feature model and features to external assets are
	examined and a way to formally handle these relations is presented

  abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPL) and agile methods share the common goal
	of rapidly developing high-quality software. Although they follow
	different approaches to achieve it, some synergies can be found between
	them by (i) applying agile techniques to SPL activities so SPL development
	becomes more agile; and (ii) tailoring agile methodologies to support
	the development of SPL. Both options require an intensive use of
	feature models, which are usually strongly affected by changes on
	requirements. Changing large-scale feature models as a consequence
	of changes on requirements is a well-known error-prone activity.
	Since one of the objectives of agile methods is a rapid response
	to changes in requirements, it is essential an automated error analysis
	support in order to make SPL development more agile and to produce
	error-free feature models. As a contribution to find the intended
	synergies, this article sets the basis to provide an automated support
	to feature model error analysis by means of a framework which is
	organized in three levels: a feature model level, where the problem
	of error treatment is described; a diagnosis level, where an abstract
	solution that relies on Reiter's theory of diagnosis is proposed;
	and an implementation level, where the abstract solution is implemented
	by using Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP). To show an application
	of our proposal, a real case study is presented where the Feature-Driven
	Development (FDD) methodology is adapted to develop an SPL. Current
	proposals on error analysis are also studied and a comparison among
	them and our proposal is provided. Lastly, the support of new kinds
	of errors and different implementation levels for the proposed framework
	are proposed as the focus of our future work.},

  abstract = {Marketing was originally built on a goods-centered, manufacturing-based
	model of economic exchange developed during the Industrial Revolution.
	Since its beginning, marketing has been broadening its perspective
	to include the exchange of more than manufactured goods. The subdiscipline
	of service marketing has emerged to address much of this broadened
	perspective, but it is built on the same goods and manufacturing-based
	model. The influence of this model is evident in the prototypical
	characteristics that have been identified as distinguishing services
	from goodsintangibility, inseparability, heterogeneity, and perishability.
	The authors argue that these characteristics (a) do not distinguish
	services from goods, (b) only have meaning from a manufacturing perspective,
	and (c) imply inappropriate normative strategies. They suggest that
	advances made by service scholars can provide a foundation for a
	more service-dominant view of all exchange from which more appropriate
	normative strategies can be developed for all of marketing.},

	functional and non-functional requirements for services because different
	applications use services in different non-functional contexts. In
	order to maximize the reusability of services, a set of constraints
	(e.g., dependency and mutual exclusion constraints) among non-functional
	requirements tend to be complicated to maintain. Currently, those
	non-functional constraints are informally specified in natural languages,
	and developers need to ensure that their applications satisfy the
	constraints in manual and ad-hoc manners. This paper proposes a model-driven
	development framework, through the notion of feature modeling, to
	explicitly and graphically specify non-functional constraints in
	SOA. The proposed framework allows developers to validate non-functional
	constraints in their applications in an automatic and consistent
	way. This paper also describes how the proposed framework is implemented
	and effectively used for service-oriented application development.},

	adopted to organize the requirements of a set of applications in
	a software domain. However, there still lacks an effective approach
	to minimizing analysts participation in feature models construction.
	In this paper, we propose a use case based semi-automatic approach
	to the construction of feature models. The basic idea of this approach
	is to first construct a set of feature models for individual applications(called
	application feature models, AFMs) in a software domain, then adjust,
	and merge the set of AFMs to form a feature model for this domain
	(called a domain feature model, DFM). The main characteristic of
	this approach is that it provides a set of rules and algorithms to
	make the construction of AFMs (from use cases) and the construction
	of DFMs (by merging a set of AFMs) be carried out automatically.
	A running example is used to illustrate the main characteristic and
	the feasibility of this approach.},

  abstract = {Feature models are widely used in domain engineering to capture common
	and variant features among systems in a particular domain. However,
	the lack of a formal semantics and reasoning support of feature models
	has hindered the development of this area. Industrial experiences
	also show that methods and tools that can support feature model analysis
	are badly appreciated. Such reasoning tool should be fully automated
	and efficient. At the same time, the reasoning tool should scale
	up well since it may need to handle hundreds or even thousands of
	features a that modern software systems may have. This paper presents
	an approach to modeling and verifying feature diagrams using Semantic
	Web OWL ontologies. We use OWL DL ontologies to precisely capture
	the inter-relationships among the features in a feature diagram.
	OWL reasoning engines such as FaCT++ are deployed to check for the
	inconsistencies of feature configurations fully automatically. Furthermore,
	a general OWL debugger has been developed to tackle the disadvantage
	of lacking debugging aids for the current OWL reasoner and to complement
	our verification approach. We also developed a CASE tool to facilitate
	visual development, interchange and reasoning of feature diagrams
