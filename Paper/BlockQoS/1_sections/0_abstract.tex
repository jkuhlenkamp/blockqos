Clients in multi-tenant datacenters mount virtualized block storage to instances provisioned by a Cloud provider. Existing shared usage models and storage abstractions imply variable storage service qualities with regards to performance, scalability and elasticity and trade-off decisions that are opaque to clients, e.g., between performance and availability. This hinders clients to effectively deploy, configure and manage applications, thus, increasing client costs and provider revenue loss and hindering the adoption of the Cloud computing programming model. We propose to reduce the storage abstraction between client and provider %and to increase tenant isolation. 
We argue that a new storage abstraction in combination with the usage of software defined storage (SDS) enables clients to benefit from predictable service qualities and provider to balance costs and revenue.

%Software defined environments (SDE) provision virtualized infrastructure in a service model on top of a pool of distributed physical infrastructure to deploy applications with different requirements. 

%To meet requirements, deployment and configuration of applications benefits from knowledge about the provisioned infrastructure. However, the service model, distribution and virtualization can result in system abstractions that prohibit consumers effective deployment and configuration of applications. 
%However, no abstraction can result in ineffective or inefficient management of SDEs for providers [this might be a second paper].
% 
%We propose to reduce abstraction on SDEs and show how different application types benefit from less abstraction in SDEs with regards to software defined storage (SDS). [what formal method do we use?]
%
%We evaluate our approach with different analytical and transactional workloads [describe testbed]. 
%
%We found that [describe results].
