	micro-benchmarks and real-world Hadoop applications. We then evaluate
	and characterize the Hadoop framework using HiBench, in terms of
	speed (i.e., job running time), throughput (i.e., the number of tasks
	completed per minute), HDFS bandwidth, system resource (e.g., CPU,
	memory and I/O) utilizations, and data access patterns.},

  booktitle = {Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS), 2012 IEEE 31st Symposium on},

  abstract = {MapReduce is a popular programming model for distributed data processing.
	Extensive research has been conducted on the reliability of MapReduce,
	ranging from adaptive and on-demand fault-tolerance to new fault-tolerance
	models. However, realistic benchmarks are still missing to analyze
	and compare the effectiveness of these proposals. To date, most MapReduce
	fault-tolerance solutions have been evaluated using micro benchmarks
	in an ad-hoc and overly simplified setting, which may not be representative
	of real-world applications. This paper presents MRBS, a comprehensive
	benchmark suite for evaluating the dependability of MapReduce systems.
	MRBS includes five benchmarks covering several application domains
	and a wide range of execution scenarios such as data-intensive vs.
	compute-intensive applications, or batch applications vs. online
	interactive applications. MRBS allows to inject various types of
	faults at different rates. It also considers different application
	workloads and data loads, and produces extensive reliability, availability
	and performance statistics. We illustrate the use of MRBS with Hadoop
	clusters running on Amazon EC2, and on a private cloud.},
