abstract = {Nowadays the Internet of Things is a new concept that attracts more and more attention of researchers. A large amount of smart objects with various communication interfaces will access the Internet of Things. Unique addressing schemes and unified communication mechanism are two basic issues. In this paper, we introduce our solutions. We designed a data platform which can work as the middleware between the physical objects and the virtual digital world. It provides RESTful Web Service, which means any physical object has the unique URI as its address and can be accessed through standard HTTP methods. We also introduce two advanced applications based on our platform, environmental perception and vehicular networks.},

@inproceedings{Lee2008,
abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are integrations of computation and physical processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. The economic and societal potential of such systems is vastly greater than what has been realized, and major investments are being made worldwide to develop the technology. There are considerable challenges, particularly because the physical components of such systems introduce safety and reliability requirements qualitatively different from those in general- purpose computing. Moreover, physical components are qualitatively different from object-oriented software components. Standard abstractions based on method calls and threads do not work. This paper examines the challenges in designing such systems, and in particular raises the question of whether today's computing and networking technologies provide an adequate foundation for CPS. It concludes that it will not be sufficient to improve design processes, raise the level of abstraction, or verify (formally or otherwise) designs that are built on today's abstractions. To realize the full potential of CPS, we will have to rebuild computing and networking abstractions. These abstractions will have to embrace physical dynamics and computation in a unified way.},

abstract = {Feature models are widely used to represent product lines and they are key parts of the development process in agile methodologies such as generative and feature- oriented programming. One of the most common problems in these cases is checking a feature model to be error-free. Some works cope with detecting errors in feature models, but automated explaination of errors is demanded in order to help the modeler to solve them. In this paper we propose a implementation-independent solution to explain the rea- sons why dead features, a common kind of error, appear in feature models, giving an implementation example.},

abstract = {In his landmark book Open Innovation, Henry Chesbrough demonstrated that because useful knowledge is no longer concentrated in a few large organizations, business leaders must adopt a new, "open" model of innovation. Using this model, companies look outside their boundaries for ideas and intellectual property (IP) they can bring in, as well as license their unutilized home-grown IP to other organizations.In Open Business Models, Chesbrough takes readers to the next step-explaining how to make money in an open innovation landscape. He provides a diagnostic instrument enabling you to assess your company's current business model, and explains how to overcome common barriers to creating a more open model. He also offers compelling examples of companies that have developed such models-including Procter \& Gamble, IBM, and Air Products.In addition, Chesbrough introduces a new set of players-"innovation intermediaries"-who facilitate companies' access to external technologies. He explores the impact of stronger IP protection on intermediate markets for innovation, and profiles firms (such as Intellectual Ventures and Qualcomm) that center their business model on innovation and IP.This vital resource provides a much-needed road map to connect innovation with IP management, so companies can create and capture value from ideas and technologies-wherever in the world they are found.},

In this paper, we explore the relationship between feature models and ontologies. First, we examine how previous extensions to basic feature modeling move it closer to richer formalisms for specifying ontologies such as MOF and OWL. Then, we explore the idea of feature models as views on ontologies. Based on that idea, we propose two approaches for the combined use of feature models and ontologies: view derivation and view integration. Finally, we give some ideas about tool support for these approaches},

@article{Schobbens2007,
abstract = {Feature Diagrams (FDs) are a family of popular modelling languages used to address the feature interaction problem, particularly in software product lines, FDs were first introduced by Kang as part of the FODA (Feature-Oriented Domain Analysis) method back in 1990. Afterwards, various extensions of FODA FDs were introduced to compensate for a purported ambiguity and lack of precision and expressiveness. However, they never received a formal semantics, which is the hallmark of precision and unambiguity and a prerequisite for efficient and safe tool automation.The reported work is intended to contribute a more rigorous approach to the definition, understanding, evaluation, selection and implementation of FD languages. First, we provide a survey of FD variants. Then, we give them a formal semantics, thanks to a generic construction that we call Free Feature Diagrams (FFDs). This demonstrates that FDs can be precise and unambiguous. This also defines their expressiveness. Many variants are expressively complete, and thus the endless quest for extensions actually cannot be justified by expressiveness. A finer notion is thus needed to compare these expressively complete languages. Two solutions are well-established: succinctness and embeddability, that express the naturalness of a language. We show that the expressively complete FDs fall into two succinctness classes, of which we of course recommend the most succinct. Among the succinct expressively complete languages, we suggest a new, simple one that is not harmfully redundant: Varied FD (VFD). Finally, we study the execution time that tools will need to solve useful problems in these languages.},

@article{WANG2007,
abstract = {Feature models are widely used in domain engineering to capture common and variant features among systems in a particular domain. However, the lack of a formal semantics and reasoning support of feature models has hindered the development of this area. Industrial experiences also show that methods and tools that can support feature model analysis are badly appreciated. Such reasoning tool should be fully automated and efficient. At the same time, the reasoning tool should scale up well since it may need to handle hundreds or even thousands of features a that modern software systems may have. This paper presents an approach to modeling and verifying feature diagrams using Semantic Web OWL ontologies. We use OWL DL ontologies to precisely capture the inter-relationships among the features in a feature diagram. OWL reasoning engines such as FaCT++ are deployed to check for the inconsistencies of feature configurations fully automatically. Furthermore, a general OWL debugger has been developed to tackle the disadvantage of lacking debugging aids for the current OWL reasoner and to complement our verification approach. We also developed a CASE tool to facilitate visual development, interchange and reasoning of feature diagrams in the Semantic Web environment.},

abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that some graph properties of protein interaction networks might be related with gene morbidity. In particular, it has been suggested that when a polymorphism affects a gene, it is more likely to produce a disease if the node degree in the interaction network is higher than for other genes. However, these results do not take into account the possible bias introduced by the variance in the amount of information available for different genes. This work models the relationship between the morbidity associated with a gene and the degrees of the nodes in the protein interaction network controlling the amount of information available in the literature. A set of 7461 genes and 3665 disease identifiers reported in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) was mined jointly with 9630 nodes and 38756 interactions of the Human Proteome Resource Database (HPRD). The information available from a gene was measured through PubMed mining. Results suggest that the correlation between the degree of a node in the protein interaction network and its morbidity is largely contributed by the information available from the gene. Even though the results suggest a positive correlation between the degree of a node and its morbidity while controlling the information factor, we believe this correlation has to be taken with caution for it can be affected by other factors not taken into account in this study.},

The software embedded in a product variant usually has to be optimized to fit its limited memory and computing power. Generative programming is well suited for developing embedded software since it allows us to automatically produce variants of embedded software optimized for specific products. This paper reports on our experience in applying generative programming in the embedded domain. We propose an extended feature modeling notation, discuss tool support for feature modeling, describe a domain-independent system configuration editor, and comment on the applicability of static configuration in the area of embedded systems.},

@article{Kang1998,
abstract = {Abstract Systematic discovery and exploitation of commonality across related software systems is a fundamental technical requirement for achieving successful software reuse. By examining a class/family of related systems and the commonality underlying those systems, it is possible to obtain a set of reference models, i.e., software architectures and components needed for implementing applications in the class. FORM (Feature-;Oriented Reuse Method) supports development of such reusable architectures and components (through a process called the "domain engineering" and development of applications using the domain artifacts produced from the domain engineering. FORM starts with an analysis of commonality among applications in a particular domain in terms of services, operating environments, domain technologies, and implementation techniques. The model constructed during the analysis is called a "feature" model, and it captures commonality as an AND/OR graph, where AND nodes indicate mandatory features and OR nodes indicate alternative features selectable for different applications. Then, this model is used to define parameterized reference architectures and appropriate reusable components instantiatable during application development. Architectures are defined from three different viewpoints (subsystem, process, and module) and have intimate association with the features. The subsystem architecture is used to package service features and allocate them to different computers in a distributed environment. Each subsystem is further decomposed into processes considering the operating environment features. Modules are defined based on the features on domain technology and implementation techniques. These architecture models that represent an architecture at different levels of abstraction are derived from the feature hierarchy captured in the feature model. Modules serve as basis for creating reusable components, and their specification defines how they are integrated into the application (e.g., as-;is integration of pre-;coded component, instantiation of parameterized templates, and filling-;in skeletal codes). Our experiences have shown that for the electronic bulletin board and the private branch exchange (PBX) domains, "features" make up for a common domain language and the main communication medium among application users and developers. Thus, the feature model well represents a "decision space" of software development, and is a good starting point for identifying candidate reusable components.},

However, providing such tool support is a huge investment that can usually not be provided for a research language. With FeatureIDE, we have built an IDE for AHEAD that integrates all phases of feature-oriented software development. To reuse this investment for other tools and languages, we refactored FeatureIDE into an open source framework that encapsulates the common ideas of feature-oriented software development and that can be reused and extended beyond AHEAD. Among others, we implemented extensions for FeatureC++ and FeatureHouse, but in general, FeatureIDE is open for everybody to showcase new research results and make them usable to a wide audience of students, researchers, and practitioners.},

abstract = {The authors present a grand tour of Generative Programming that is bound to become a classic. They . . . focus on the generally unappreciated connection between Domain Specific Languages and Generative Programming as a motivation for future development. Their wide-ranging and practical methods for Domain Analysis and Domain Engineering describe the first steps that developers can take right now . . . and are valuable both when existing systems are used or in preparation for emerging new generative technologies." -Charles Simonyi, Chief Architect at Microsoft Research and the inventor of Intentional Programming "The book develops strong themes around unifying principles that tie the pieces together, most notably domain engineering and metaprogramming. It is crucial to understand that this book is not just some refreshing diversion, nor just an exposition of some noteworthy niche techniques: It is a harbinger of a broader enlightenment that opens the door to a new age." -From the Foreword by James Coplien, a Distinguished Member of Technical Staff at Lucent Technologies, Bell Laboratories Generative Programming (GP) offers great promise to application developers. It makes the idea of moving from one-of-a-kind software systems to the semi-automated manufacture of wide varieties of software quite real. In short, GP is about recognizing the benefits of automation in software development. Generative Programming covers methods and tools that will help you design and implement the right components for a system family and automate component assembly. The methods presented here are applicable for all commercial development-from "programming in the small," at the level of classes and procedures-to "programming in the large," or developing families of large systems. Generative Programming is your complete guide and reference to this emerging discipline. It provides in-depth treatment of critical technologies and topics including: Domain Engineering Feature Modeling Generic Programming Aspect-Oriented Programming Template Metaprogramming in C++ Generators Microsoft's Intentional Programming Using this book you will learn how these techniques fit together and, more importantly, how to apply them in practice. The text contains three comprehensive case studies in three different domains: programming domain (container data structures), business domain (banking), and scientific computing (matrix computations).},

@article{Chen2005,
abstract = {Feature models have been widely adopted in software reuse to organize the requirements of a set of similar applications in a software domain/product line. However, in most feature-oriented methods, the construction of feature models heavily depends on the domain analysts' personal understanding, and the work of constructing feature models from the original requirements of sample applications is often tedious and ineffective. This paper proposes a semiautomatic approach to constructing feature models based on requirements clustering, which automates the activities of feature identification, organization and variability modeling to a great extent. The underlying idea of this approach is to analyze the relationships between individual requirements and cluster tight-related requirements into features. With the automatic support of this approach, good quality feature models can be constructed in a more effective way. A case study is also provided to show the feasibility of this approach.},

In particular when dealing with non-functional goals, also known as softgoals, the modelerfaces the problem of how to elicit the complex web of intertwined relationships that exist between them. We tackle this problem by using the Personal Construct Theory (PCT), a well known work in cognitive science. We describe the results of applying PCT to the problem of finding relationships between nonfunctional goals. The process is a heuristic one, and our results, so far, are positive.},

abstract = {Strategic Market Relationships, 2nd Edition develops the reader s understanding of the nature, relevance and importance of creating and sustaining relationships as a strategic resource. It takes a managerial perspective to the study of relationships, from strategy to implementation. The first edition was the first text that comprehensively addressed relationships as a strategic issue, and considering relationships as strategic and as a basis for competition is central to this book. In a nutshell, strategic market relationships is the process of analyzing, formulating and implementing a relationship strategy for an organisation. The new edition is being totally restructured in the light of teaching experience with the book and new research since it was published. Most of the existing content will still be there but presented in a new logic. Continues to map relationships from strategy to implementation Text more clearly divided into strategy and implementation parts Continues to focus on close relationships and on the management of relationships Continues with introductory case illustration and end of chapter teaching cases with many new ones All chapter updated with new research since the last publication Revamped chapter on relationship planning including a stronger focus on strategic choice and relationship development New chapter on relationship types/archetypes to develop on the theme of classification and the management of specific relationships New chapter on organizing relationships New chapter on people and relationships E-relationship chapter integrated into chapter on communication and dialogue in a relationship New chapter on channel relationships Chapter on relationship performance restructured around costs and value. Ethics and researching relationships expanded in the conclusion chapter},

abstract = {Modelling the variable aspects of software architectures (SA) is key to develop product families (P-F) or product-lines (P-L. The difficulty to model this variability impacts the full life cycle of the product family, and specially its architecture. In addition, the physical view of architecture reflects most of the variability of the system. This work outlines the use of the concept of features for modelling the variable aspects in distributed systems. The goal we state here is to define the attributes needed to permit a description of system properties as well as quality-of-service (QoS) parameters, which can be applied to different parts of a distributed architecture. To do this we have extended the ideas and concepts of the FODA (Featured-Oriented Domain Analysis) features model to include numerical values able to represent the variability needed by software systems.},

@article{Kang1998a,
abstract = {Discovery and exploitation of commonality across related software systems is a fundamental technical requirement for achieving successful software reuse. By examining a class/family of related systems and the commonality underlying those systems, it is possible to obtain a set of reference models, i.e., software architectures and components needed for implementing applications in the class. FORM (Feature-;Oriented Reuse Method) supports development of such reusable architectures and components (through a process called the domain engineering) and development of applications using the domain artifacts produced from the domain engineering. FORM starts with an analysis of commonality among applications in a particular domain in terms of services, operating environments, domain technologies, and implementation techniques. The model constructed during the analysis is called a feature model, and it captures commonality as an AND/OR graph, where AND nodes indicate mandatory features and OR nodes indicate alternative features selectable for different applications. Then, this model is used to define parameterized reference architectures and appropriate reusable components instantiatable during application development. Architectures are defined from three different viewpoints (subsystem, process, and module) and have intimate association with the features. The subsystem architecture is used to package service features and allocate them to different computers in a distributed environment. Each subsystem is further decomposed into processes considering the operating environment features. Modules are defined based on the features on domain technology and implementation techniques. These architecture models that represent an architecture at different levels of abstraction are derived from the feature hierarchy captured in the feature model. Modules serve as basis for creating reusable components, and their specification defines how they are integrated into the application (e.g., as-;is integration of pre-;coded component, instantiation of parameterized templates, and filling-;in skeletal codes). Our experiences have shown that for the electronic bulletin board and the private branch exchange (PBX) domains, features make up for a common domain language and the main communication medium among application users and developers. Thus, the feature model well represents a decision space of software development, and is a good starting point for identifying candidate reusable components.},

@inproceedings{Cho2007,
abstract = {A workflow model has been successively applied to traditional computing environments such as business processes for service automation. Recently, there are many studies that have tried to adopt workflows to ubiquitous computing. A service in the ubiquitous computing environments must be executed according to a user's situation information. However existing workflow systems have not yet included functions enough to support context-aware services for ubiquitous computing. In this paper, we propose a new context- aware workflow language and system for ubiquitous computing environments. The suggested language can specify context information on the transition constraints of a workflow, and support various workflow functions and adaptive services. And the proposed system can offer context-aware services according to user's service demand or situation information. We verify the efficiency of the suggested system, through comparison experiments with existing workflow systems such as FollowMe and uFlow.},

abstract = {Feature modeling is a key technique for capturing commonalities and variabilities in system families and product lines. In this paper, we propose a cardinality-based notation for feature modeling, which integrates a number of existing extensions of previous approaches. We then introduce and motivate the novel concept of staged configuration. Staged configuration can be achieved by the stepwise specialization of feature models or by multi-level configuration, where the configuration choices available in each stage are defined by separate feature models. Staged configuration is important because in a realistic development process, different groups and different people make product configuration choices in different stages. Finally, we also discuss how multi-level configuration avoids a breakdown between the different abstraction levels of individual features. This problem, sometimes referred to as analysis paralysis , easily occurs in feature modeling because features can denote entities at arbitrary levels of abstractions within a system family.},

However, in the SPL community it is well recognized that variability in SPLs is increasing by the thousands. Hence, an automatic support is needed to deal with variability in SPL. Most of the current proposals for automatic reasoning on SPL are not devised to cope with extrafunctional features. In this paper we introduce a proposal to model and reason on an SPL using constraint programming. We take into account functional and extrafunctional features, improve current proposals and present a running, yet feasible implementation.},

abstract = {Service-oriented architectures are the upcoming business standard for realizing enterprise information systems, thus creating a need for analysis and design methods that are truly service-oriented. Most research on this topic so far takes a software engineering perspective. For a proper alignment between business and IT, a service perspective at the business level is needed as well. In this paper, a unified view of services is introduced by means of a service ontology, service classification and service layer architecture. On the basis of these service models, a service design method is proposed and applied to a case from the literature. The design method capitalizes on existing value modeling approaches.},

@article{Cysneiros2004,
abstract = {Nonfunctional requirements (NFRs) have been frequently neglected or forgotten in software design. They have been presented as a second or even third class type of requirement, frequently hidden inside notes. We tackle this problem by treating NFRs as first class requirements. We present a process to elicit NFRs, analyze their interdependencies, and trace them to functional conceptual models. We focus our attention on conceptual models expressed using UML (Unified Modeling Language). Extensions to UML are proposed to allow NFRs to be expressed. We show how to integrate NFRs into the class, sequence, and collaboration diagrams. We also show how use cases and scenarios can be adapted to deal with NFRs. This work was used in three case studies and their results suggest that by using our proposal we can improve the quality of the resulting conceptual models.},

@book{Gamma1995,
abstract = {Design Patterns is a modern classic in the literature of object-oriented development, offering timeless and elegant solutions to common problems in software design. It describes patterns for managing object creation, composing objects into larger structures, and coordinating control flow between objects. The book provides numerous examples where using composition rather than inheritance can improve the reusability and flexibility of code. Note, though, that it's not a tutorial but a catalog that you can use to find an object-oriented design pattern that's appropriate for the needs of your particular application-a selection for virtuoso programmers who appreciate (or require) consistent, well-engineered object-oriented designs. Now on CD, this internationally acclaimed bestseller is more valuable than ever! Use the contents of the CD to create your own design documents and reusable components. The CD contains: 23 patterns you can cut and paste into your own design documents; sample code demonstrating pattern implementation; complete Design Patterns content in standard HTML format, with numerous hyperlinked cross-references; accessed through a standard web browser; Java-based dynamic search mechanism, enhancing online seach capabilities; graphical user environment, allowing ease of navigation. First published in 1995, this landmark work on object-oriented software design presents a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to common design problems. Created by four experienced designers, the 23 patterns contained herein have become an essential resource for anyone developing reusable object-oriented software. In response to reader demand, the complete text and pattern catalog are now available on CD-ROM. This electronic version of Design Patterns enables programmers to install the book directly onto a computer or network for use as an online reference for creating reusable object-oriented software. The authors first describe what patterns are and how they can help you in the design process. They then systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. All patterns are compiled from real-world examples and include code that demonstrates how they may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages such as C++ and Smalltalk. Readers who already own the book will want the CD to take advantage of its dynamic search mechanism and ready-to-install patterns.},

abstract = {In the research of software reuse, feature models have been widely adopted to organize the requirements of a set of applications in a software domain. However, there still lacks an effective approach to minimizing analysts participation in feature models construction. In this paper, we propose a use case based semi-automatic approach to the construction of feature models. The basic idea of this approach is to first construct a set of feature models for individual applications(called application feature models, AFMs) in a software domain, then adjust, and merge the set of AFMs to form a feature model for this domain (called a domain feature model, DFM). The main characteristic of this approach is that it provides a set of rules and algorithms to make the construction of AFMs (from use cases) and the construction of DFMs (by merging a set of AFMs) be carried out automatically. A running example is used to illustrate the main characteristic and the feasibility of this approach.},

To represent assets belonging to the core of the family and assets belonging to variable parts, feature modeling is a widely used concept. Consistency checking in feature models is not yet addressed appropriately by current methods. This paper gives a brief overview of feature modeling and elaborates the problems of current approaches. Based on the applications of these approaches within an ongoing research project this paper proposes a formalized definition for feature modeling using the Object Constraint Language (OCL) and a set of associations and constraints to be used in the feature model. The relations between features in the feature model and features to external assets are examined and a way to formally handle these relations is presented as a result of a research project.},

@article{Trinidad2008,
abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPL) and agile methods share the common goal of rapidly developing high-quality software. Although they follow different approaches to achieve it, some synergies can be found between them by (i) applying agile techniques to SPL activities so SPL development becomes more agile; and (ii) tailoring agile methodologies to support the development of SPL. Both options require an intensive use of feature models, which are usually strongly affected by changes on requirements. Changing large-scale feature models as a consequence of changes on requirements is a well-known error-prone activity. Since one of the objectives of agile methods is a rapid response to changes in requirements, it is essential an automated error analysis support in order to make SPL development more agile and to produce error-free feature models. As a contribution to find the intended synergies, this article sets the basis to provide an automated support to feature model error analysis by means of a framework which is organized in three levels: a feature model level, where the problem of error treatment is described; a diagnosis level, where an abstract solution that relies on Reiter's theory of diagnosis is proposed; and an implementation level, where the abstract solution is implemented by using Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP). To show an application of our proposal, a real case study is presented where the Feature-Driven Development (FDD) methodology is adapted to develop an SPL. Current proposals on error analysis are also studied and a comparison among them and our proposal is provided. Lastly, the support of new kinds of errors and different implementation levels for the proposed framework are proposed as the focus of our future work.},

abstract = {The increasing usage of smart embedded devices in business blurs the line between the virtual and real worlds. This creates new opportunities to build applications that better integrate real-time state of the physical world, and hence, provides enterprise services that are highly dynamic, more diverse, and efficient. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) approaches traditionally used to couple functionality of heavyweight corporate IT systems, are becoming applicable to embedded real-world devices, i.e., objects of the physical world that feature embedded processing and communication. In such infrastructures, composed of large numbers of networked, resource-limited devices, the discovery of services and on-demand provisioning of missing functionality is a significant challenge. We propose a process and a suitable system architecture that enables developers and business process designers to dynamically query, select, and use running instances of real-world services (i.e., services running on physical devices) or even deploy new ones on-demand, all in the context of composite, real-world business applications.},

@article{Woodruff1997,
abstract = {Driven by more demanding customers, global competition, and slow-growth economies and industries, many organizations search for new ways to achieve and retain a competitive advantage. Past attempts have largely looked internally within the organization for improvement, such as reflected by quality management, reengineering, downsizing, and restructuring. The next major source for competitive advantage likely will come from more outward orientation toward customers, as indicated by the many calls for organizations to compete on superior customer value delivery. Although the reasons for these calls are sound, what are the implications for managing organizations in the next decade and beyond? This article addresses this question. It presents frameworks for thinking about customer value, customer value learning, and the related skills that managers will need to create and implement superior customer value strategies.},

@article{Mikkonen2010,
abstract = {The Web has become pervasive. This has led to a paradigm shift, where applications live on the Web as services, where they can be accessed using terminals of different types, such as regular computers, mobile devices, game consoles, and so on. The ability to dynamically combine data, code and other content from numerous web sites all over the world, and the ability to instantly publish services worldwide has opened up entirely new possibilities for software development. Such applications, referred to as mashups, are content aggregates that leverage the power of the Web to support instant, worldwide sharing of content. Unfortunately, for various reasons, the browser that is commonly used as the run-time environment of mashups is inadequate for hosting complex applications, in particular when considering embedded devices and subsystems that are not readily available in the web. In this paper, we introduce a runtime environment, intended for embedded devices, that is able to host mashups that combine data from the web and device specific peripherals, thus enabling context-aware mashups. As an example, we describe a mashup that combines map data from an existing map service and GPS data available from an external system.},

Feature modeling has several pplications in generative software development, including domain analysis, product-line scoping, and feature-based product specification.

We show that the Object-Constraint Language (OCL) can adequately capture such constraints. Furthermore, we identify a set of facilities based on constraint satisfaction that can be provided by feature modeling and feature-based configuration tools and present a prototype implementing some of these facilities. We report on our experience with the prototype and give directions for future work.},

The automated analysis of feature models is being recognized as one of the key challenges for automated software development in the context of Software Product Lines. In our previous work we explained how a feature model can be transformed into a constraint satisfaction problem. However cardinalities were not considered. In this paper we present how a cardinality-based feature model can be also translated into a constraint satisfaction problem. In that connection, it is possible to use off-the-shelf tools to automatically accomplish several tasks such as calculating the number of possible feature configurations and detecting possible conflicts. In addition, we present a performance test between two off-the-shelf Java constraint solvers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a performance test is presented using solvers for feature modelling proposes 1},

abstract = {Variability models, feature diagrams ahead, have become commonplace in the software product lines engineering literature. Whereas ongoing research keeps improving their expressiveness, formalisation and automation, more experience reports on their usage in real projects are needed. This paper describes some challenges encountered during the re-engineering of PloneMeeting, an Open Source software family, into a software product line. The main challenging issues we could observe were (i) the ambiguity originating from implicit information (missing definitions of feature labels and unclear modelling viewpoint), (ii) the necessity of representing spurious features, (iii) the difficulty of making diagrams and constraints resistant to change, and (iv) the risks of using feature attributes to represent large sets of subfeatures. Our study reveals the limitations of current constructs, and calls for both language and methodological improvements. It also suggests further comparative evaluations of modelling alternatives.},

@book{Chesbrough2003,
abstract = {In todays information-rich environment, companies can no longer afford to rely entirely on their own ideas to advance their business, nor can they restrict their innovations to a single path to market. As a result, says Harvard Business School professor Henry W. Chesbrough, the traditional model for innovation-which has been largely internally focused, closed off from outside ideas and technologies-is becoming obsolete. Emerging in its place is a new paradigm, open innovation, which strategically leverages internal and external sources of ideas and takes them to market through multiple paths. This path-breaking analysis is based on extensive field research, academic study, and the authors own longtime experience working in Silicon Valley. Through rich descriptions of the innovation processes of Xerox, IBM, Lucent, Intel, Merck, and Millennium, and the many spin-offs that have emerged from these firms, Open Innovation shows how companies can use their business model to identify a more enlightened role for R\&D in a world of abundant information, better manage and access intellectual property, advance their current business, and grow their future business. Arguing that companies in all industries must transform the way they commercialize knowledge, Chesbrough convincingly shows how open innovation can unlock the latent economic value in a companys ideas and technologies.},

abstract = {This paper describes a feature modelling technique aimed at modelling the software assets behind a product family. The proposed technique is distinctive in five respects. First, it proposes a feature meta-model that avoids the need for model normalization found in other meta-models. Second, it uses an XSL-based mechanism to express complex composition rules for the features. Third, it offers a means to decompose large feature diagrams into extensible and self-contained modules. Fourth, it defines an XML-based approach to expressing the feature models that offers a low-cost path to the development of support tools for building the models. Fifth, it explicitly supports both the modelling of the product family and of the applications instantiated from it. The paper presents the feature modelling technique in the context of an on-going project to build a generative environment for family instantiation. The experience from two cases studies is also discussed.},

abstract = {It is important in service oriented architecture (SOA) to separate functional and non-functional requirements for services because different applications use services in different non-functional contexts. In order to maximize the reusability of services, a set of constraints (e.g., dependency and mutual exclusion constraints) among non-functional requirements tend to be complicated to maintain. Currently, those non-functional constraints are informally specified in natural languages, and developers need to ensure that their applications satisfy the constraints in manual and ad-hoc manners. This paper proposes a model-driven development framework, through the notion of feature modeling, to explicitly and graphically specify non-functional constraints in SOA. The proposed framework allows developers to validate non-functional constraints in their applications in an automatic and consistent way. This paper also describes how the proposed framework is implemented and effectively used for service-oriented application development.},

abstract = {In the "Internet of Things" vision, the physical world becomes integrable with computer networks. Embedded computers or visual markers on everyday objects allow things and information about them to be accessible in the digital world. However, this integration is based on competing standards and requires custom solutions, thus requires extensive time and technical expertise. Based on the success of Web 2.0 mashup applications, we propose a similar approach for integrating real-world devices to the Web, allowing for them to be easily combined with other virtual and physical resources. In this paper we discuss possible integration method, in particular how the REST principles can be applied to embedded devices. Then we illustrate these principles with two concrete implementations: on the Sun SPOT platform and on the Ploggs wireless energy monitors. Finally, we show how RESTful interactions can be leveraged to quickly create new prototypes and mashups that combine the physical and virtual world.},

Written in the same concise way and covering all the facts, readers will find that this title succinctly covers the key aspects of the ITIL V3 upgrade. The new ITIL V3 approach covering the ITIL Lifecycle is fully covered. In addition those who are familiar with the Version 2 process approach will be delighted to discover that this new edition of Foundations of IT Service Management based on ITIL V3 has split out all the processes and describes them in detail. This means that it is easy for all readers to access and grasp the process concepts that are so pivotal to many service management day-to-day operations.},

abstract = {Ranking is a very important topic in information retrieval. While algorithms for learning ranking models have been intensively studied, this is not the case for feature selection, despite of its importance. The reality is that many feature selection methods used in classification are directly applied to ranking. We argue that because of the striking differences between ranking and classification, it is better to develop different feature selection methods for ranking. To this end, we propose a new feature selection method in this paper. Specifically, for each feature we use its value to rank the training instances, and define the ranking accuracy in terms of a performance measure or a loss function as the importance of the feature. We also define the correlation between the ranking results of two features as the similarity between them. Based on the definitions, we formulate the feature selection issue as an optimization problem, for which it is to find the features with maximum total importance scores and minimum total similarity scores. We also demonstrate how to solve the optimization problem in an efficient way. We have tested the effectiveness of our feature selection method on two information retrieval datasets and with two ranking models. Experimental results show that our method can outperform traditional feature selection methods for the ranking task.},

abstract = {The Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) initiative of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) defines standards for Web Service interfaces and data encodings usable as building blocks to implement a Sensor Web for geospatial applications. These standards encapsulate heterogeneous sensors installed in existing sensor networks for web-based discovery, scheduling and access. SWE has been applied in a multitude of projects in the recent years, showing its suitability in real world scenarios. However, there is still a fundamental challenge to be tackled. While SWE enables interoperability and is well-designed towards the upper application layer, the interaction between the Sensor Web and the underlying sensor network layer is not yet sufficiently described. This work identifies five fundamental interaction patterns between the Sensor Web and sensor networks by introducing an intermediary layer, prototypically implemented using Twitter. The patterns bridge the gap between the two distinct layers and are essential for enabling future sensor plug \& play within the Sensor Web.},

abstract = {Feature modeling is a common method used to capture the variability in a configurable application. A key challenge developers face when using a feature model is determining how to select a set of features for a variant that simultaneously satisfy a series of resource constraints. This paper presents an approximation technique for selecting highly optimal feature sets while adhering to resource limits. The paper provides the following contributions to configuring application variants from feature models: (1) we provide a polynomial time approximation algorithm for selecting a highly optimal set of features that adheres to a set of resource constraints, (2) we show how this algorithm can incorporate complex configuration constraints; and (3) we present empirical results showing that the approximation algorithm can be used to derive feature sets that are more than 90\%+ optimal.},

abstract = {In the field of Cyber Physical Systems and Pervasive Computing, physical resources and web resources can be easily handled and seamlessly integrated into our life. However, due to the heterogeneity of devices and tight coupling of individual information systems, the developers cannot easily create their specific applications by combining with physical and web resources. In this paper, we proposed Rest Thing which is a restful web service infrastructure based on REST principles in order to hide the heterogeneity of devices and provide a seamless way to integrate embedded devices with existing web applications. Besides, we implemented a prototyping system, which provided the restful accessible way of the wireless sensors, and built a demo application on the smart phone to collect and merge physical and web resources. Finally, we gave the performance evaluation of the prototyping system.},

abstract = {Marketing was originally built on a goods-centered, manufacturing-based model of economic exchange developed during the Industrial Revolution. Since its beginning, marketing has been broadening its perspective to include the exchange of more than manufactured goods. The subdiscipline of service marketing has emerged to address much of this broadened perspective, but it is built on the same goods and manufacturing-based model. The influence of this model is evident in the prototypical characteristics that have been identified as distinguishing services from goodsintangibility, inseparability, heterogeneity, and perishability. The authors argue that these characteristics (a) do not distinguish services from goods, (b) only have meaning from a manufacturing perspective, and (c) imply inappropriate normative strategies. They suggest that advances made by service scholars can provide a foundation for a more service-dominant view of all exchange from which more appropriate normative strategies can be developed for all of marketing.},

abstract = {Methods for managing innovation have been described in academia in many contexts. Service innovation processes pose particular challenges compared to those of product innovation - one of the core reasons being the lack of dedicated R\&D structures in service firms or units. Collaborative innovation both with employees and with customers can be an effective means to drive innovation in services. Based on empirical evidence of a study of German innovation managers, this paper discusses findings of service innovation in organizational practice. We review the current extent and future potential of the involvement of employees and customers in the innovation process, as well implications for companies and academia.},

abstract = {Innovative e-business projects start with a design of the e-business model. We often encounter the view, in research as well as industry practice, that an e-business model is similar to a business process model, and so can be specified using UML activity diagrams or Petri nets. In this paper, we explain why this is a misunderstanding. The root cause is that a business model is not about process but about value exchanged between actors. Failure to make this separation of concerns leads to poor business decision-making and inadequate business requirements.},

It starts by investigating the issues at stake and explores how the EU is addressing the identified concerns. The study then examines the legal aspects in relation to the right to data protection, the issues of jurisdiction, responsibility and regulation of data transfers to third countries. These questions have been neglected in EU policies and strategies, despite very strong implications on EU data sovereignty and the protection of citizens’ rights.},

abstract = {A software product line (SPL) enables stakeholders to derive different software products for a domain while providing a high degree of reuse of their code units. Software products are derived in a configuration process by composing different code units. The configuration process becomes complex if SPLs contain hundreds of features. In many cases, a stakeholder is not only interested in functional but also in non-functional properties of a desired product. Because SPLs can be used in different application scenarios alternative implementations of already existing functionality are developed to meet special non-functional requirements, like restricted binary size and performance guarantees. To enable these complex configurations we discuss and present techniques to measure non-functional properties of software modules and use these values to compute SPL configurations optimized to the users needs.},

abstract = {The urgent need for the performance of more, better designed, and better conducted randomised clinical trials is increasingly recognised. Based on structured interviews with leading persons of 43 outstanding organisations and units involved in clinical trials in Europe and North America during 1993, ways of organising and staffing clinical trial units were investigated. The present proposal is based on this experience from which an attempt to extract a composite set of minimal requirements has been made regarding pertinent objectives and aims, organisational aspects, staffing, and estimated costs of establishing a clinical trial unit. The core staff is suggested to consist of two chief physicians, one statistician, one data manager, one project coordinator, and two secretaries. In order to fulfil the minimal requirements for running such a unit, it is calculated that about GBP 450,000 per year is needed to cover investments, core staff, and running costs, but excluding housing costs and costs of randomised clinical trials that do not originate from trial coordination. In return, such a unit should be able to mount and launch 6-7 multicenter randomised clinical trials during a 5 year period, corresponding to a total cost for coordination per trial of about GBP 340,000. However, with a larger staff more studies may be coordinated possibly reducing the cost per trial depending on greater effectiveness in utilisation of the basic facilities.},

@phdthesis{Fielding2000,
abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The Web has been iteratively developed over the past ten years through a series of modifications to the standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those aspects of the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable modifications, a model for the modern Web architecture was needed to guide its design, definition, and deployment. Software architecture research investigates methods for determining how best to partition a system, how components identify and communicate with each other, how information is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve independently, and how all of the above can be described using formal and informal notations. My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software through principled use of architectural constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. An architectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints. This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture via architectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architectural design of network-based application software. A survey of architectural styles for network-based applications is used to classify styles according to the architectural properties they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style and describe how REST has been used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web. REST emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. Finally, I describe the lessons learned from applying REST to the design of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier standards, and from their subsequent deployment in Web client and server software.},

@techreport{Kang1990,
abstract = {Successful software reuse requires the systematic discovery and exploitation of commonality across related software systems. By examining related software systems and the underlying theory of the class of systems they represent, domain analysis can provide a generic description of the requirements of that class of systems and a set of approaches for their implementation. This report will establish methods for performing a domain analysis and describe the products of the domain analysis process. To illustrate the application of domain analysis to a representative class of software systems, this report will provide a domain analysis of window management system software.},
